# Salon-booking-application
## Overview
We’ve all been there… split ends, faded colour, that weird cowlick that just won’t be tamed — total hair frustration. Sometimes it comes up at the oddest times and you just feel that NEED to get in to the salon ASAP. But stop for a minute and THINK: is showing up at the salon impulsively REALLY the best way to get what you want? Yeah, I know – booking your appointment ahead of time can be a chore, but your hair should have regularly scheduled upkeep, and the best way to do this is to plan ahead.

## General Objective
This is a custome moile application whose objective is to check the salon availaility and book at a convenient time. The application allows one to check the salon status; like how many people are in the waiting list. If no one is there, one can proceed to book the appointment.
